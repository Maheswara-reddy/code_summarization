Imported an inbult library pygame
. Here we are equating white and (255, values. Here we are equating black and (0, values. Here we are equating red and (255, values. Here we are equating dis and pygame.display.set_mode((800, values.  The attribute display is applied on pygame. Here we are equating game_over and False values. Here we are equating x1 and 300 values. Here we are equating y1 and 300 values. Here we are equating x1_change and 0 values. Here we are equating y1_change and 0 values. Here we are equating clock and pygame.time.Clock() values.  The attribute time is applied on pygame. A conditional while statement that satisfies the condition  between while and game_over. We are iterating the for loop in pygame.event.get. . Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.type and pygame.QUITThe attribute pygame is applied on QUIT. . Here we are equating game_over and True values. Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.type and pygame.KEYDOWNThe attribute pygame is applied on KEYDOWN. . Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_LEFTThe attribute pygame is applied on K_LEFT. . Here we are equating x1_change and -10 values. Here we are equating y1_change and 0 values. Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_RIGHTThe attribute pygame is applied on K_RIGHT. .  This is the elif condition of the if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_RIGHTThe attribute pygame is applied on K_RIGHT. . Here we are equating x1_change and 10 values. Here we are equating y1_change and 0 values. Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_UPThe attribute pygame is applied on K_UP. .  This is the elif condition of the if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_UPThe attribute pygame is applied on K_UP. . Here we are equating y1_change and -10 values. Here we are equating x1_change and 0 values. Here there is an if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_DOWNThe attribute pygame is applied on K_DOWN. .  This is the elif condition of the if loop that checks equality condition between event.key and pygame.K_DOWNThe attribute pygame is applied on K_DOWN. . Here we are equating y1_change and 10 values. Here we are equating x1_change and 0 values. We are increamenting the value of x1 by x1_change. We are increamenting the value of y1 by y1_change.
